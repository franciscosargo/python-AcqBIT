    "An important aspect to evaluate long-term acquisition is the characterization of missing samples. Theoretically, missing samples are the result of time-wise expensive computation between reads from the BITalino device. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the acquisition computer, the process of long term-acquisition can be seen essentialy conceptualized as single continuos loop that, in each iteration, reads data from device and performs <font color=red>additional computation</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single process on, implemented in the computer by *python-AcqBIT/bitalino_process.py* is associated with a single device, and thus a single *macAddress*.\n",
    "Depending on the configuration variable *nSamples*, which controls the number of samples to retrieve from device in each read, the process waits the necessary span of time in order to fully retrieve the number of samples specified, an interval which is, of course, a function of the configuration variable *samplingRate*. And then, once recieval is finished, the aditional computation can proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the BITalino device, once the acquisition is started, the continuous sampling of each channel maintains a constant flow of data streaming from the CPU to the Bluetooth Module. Once the sampled data arrives at the module, it is temporarily stored in a buffer awaiting transmission via radio waves, which is initated by a signal of acceptance comming from the acquisition computer (in this instance, by the function *read*). The size of the buffer is determinant in the quantification of missing samples."
